# ** DIGITAL LIBRARY MANAGEMENT **

The main objective of this project is to provide a complete automated Library by digitizing its
each and every functionality. Starting from the book-keeping, issuing of books, fine
generation, advance booking and report generation all will be accomplished under one single
project. The project will be a web based project with a database server responsible for
maintaining every single detail of the Library. It has a very user friendly interface which can
easily be operated by any non-technical person.
This is a 2<sup>nd</sup> task to built a <b>DIGITAL LIBRARY MANAGEMENT</b> Java Development Internship at <b>Code-Casa
